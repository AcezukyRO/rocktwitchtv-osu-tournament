Match Rules:
- Respect to the referee and the players, if we found that you behave offensively, you can have a chance to be disqualified.
- All matches will be 1v1, HeadToHead, ScoreV2.
- Only Final has BO9 format. Everything else are BO7.
- There will be a referee invite you before each matches 15 minutes. Besure to be active in osu! at that time.
- If one of players doesn't show up at the lobby at scheduled time, they have 10 minutes to show up. If one of player doesn't show up, the   match will be defaulted to the one in the lobby. If both players fail to show up, both players will be disqualified.
- When both players are in lobby, the referee will tell players to roll. Higher roll will get first warmup pick, second ban and first pick.
- If any of players disconnect during the match for first 30 seconds, the match will be replayed, else, the point will go toward to the       other. If a player disconected in the lobby, they have 10 minutes to show ups.
- Time to pick and bans is 90 seconds. If a player failed to pick,ban after this time, the opponent will be allowed to pick/ban.
- There are total 2 warmups, 2 bans.
- For FM maps, players are forced to pick at least one mod. The range of mods are HR, HD, EZ, FL and SO. You can stack these mods fo r       higher score if you want. This rule applies for Tiebreaker as well, but for Tiebreaker, you are not forced to pick any mods at all.
- If the match ends in a tie, the tiebreaker will be played.
- During a song, if you failed until the end, your score will not be counted. If both players are failed at the end, player who has higher   score will be counted.
